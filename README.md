## Goal

The goal of the learning task was to classifying cuisines based on the ingredients in a recipe.

## Dataset Overview
Kaggle had provided three data files for this competition: train.json (consisting of the training data), test.json (consisting of the test data) and sample_submission.csv (depicting the format of the submission file Kaggle expected).

## Final Model 
I found that the best performing model was an SVM classifier, with an accuracy of 79.74% on the test set.
